Focusing on a specific smart office building, I did a series of studies to 

conducted four workshops with 27 participants (building users) over a period of two months, to understand their perceptions, concerns and aspirations about data collection and use within the building. A range of qualitative research methods were employed, such as Focus group discussions, Design Fiction and Story Telling activities.
This resulted in a design agenda for improving smart buildingâ€™s occupant experiences and increasing the perceivability, accessibility, and usability of data in such buildings.
This work was published in the ACM CHI 2023 conference proceedings.

My role in the project was twofold. I worked with the rest of the IT Innovation team in designing and programming apps for demo deployments. This involved designing dialog flows, ext to speech/speech to text conversions, front end development in python integrating various APIs, designing interactions for tablet (content, UI), testing and debuging.

Second, I collected field observations to support research and development activities. We specifically focused on children, improving the Robot's response time through combining both tablet and voice interaction loops.
