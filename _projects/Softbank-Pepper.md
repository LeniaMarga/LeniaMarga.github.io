Pepper is a customisable humanoid Robot provided by [Softbank](https://us.softbankrobotics.com/pepper). Pepper supports programming intuitive interactions that involve natural language, gestures, face recognition and screen interaction. In [COSMOTE-DT IT Innovation Team](https://www.cosmote.gr/static/otegroup/en/page/it_innovation_center_new), we customized the Robot to engage, entertain and assist customers in retail shops. In collaboration with [Athena Research center](https://www.athenarc.gr/en/research), our team was working towards integrating Pepper services with a custom NLP to improve speech recognition and support a wider range of conversations in Greek language with diverse users, as well as improving gestural and voice response sequences. Our aim was ultimately the long term deployment of Pepper in key COSMOTE stores to support and entertain customers - -e.g. advertise products, provide instructions on where to find a product and answer questions on prices and special offers. 

Through a series of demo deployments in a COSMOTE flagship stores at Athens, our team collected observations to support research activities, engaging customers in interacting with the Robot. Initially, these demo deployments were mostly entertaining: for example, we programmed Pepper to provide real time weather forecast for the next hours or tell jokes. Interactions grew complex over time: for instance, scanning someone's face, identifying age and gender, and providing targeted advertisement of products through voice and visual feedback (tablet screen).

My role in the project was twofold. I worked with the rest of the IT Innovation team in designing and programming apps for demo deployments. This involved developing voice interaction applications, designing dialog flows and front end development in python integrating various APIs . The majority of tasks I have programmed are informative dialogs and text to speech and speech to text conversions. 



I have assisted in user testing and collecting field observations for further research and development. A specific focus group were children. 

One of the key difficulties in interacting with Pepper was its response time: the Robot needed a few seconds
