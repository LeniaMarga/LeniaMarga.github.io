Pepper is a customisable humanoid Robot provided by [Softbank](https://us.softbankrobotics.com/pepper). Pepper supports programming intuitive interactions that involve natural language, gestures, face recognition and more. 

In [COSMOTE-DT IT Innovation Team](https://www.cosmote.gr/static/otegroup/en/page/it_innovation_center_new), we customized the Robot to engage, entertain and assist customers in retail shops -e.g. advertise products, provide instructions on where to find a product and answers questions on prices and special offers. In collaboration with [Athena Research center](https://www.athenarc.gr/en/research), our team was working towards integrating Pepper services with a custom NLP to improve speech recognition and support a wider range of conversations in Greek language with diverse users such as children, as well as improving gestural and voice response sequences. Our aim was ultimately the long term deployment of Pepper in key COSMOTE stores to support and entertain customers.

Through a series of demo deployments in a COSMOTE flagship stores at Glyfada and Marousi, Athens, our team collected observations to support research activities, while entertaining customers and engaging them in learning to interact with the Robot. Initially, these demo deployments were mostly entertaining - for example, we programmed Pepper to provide real time weather forecast for the next hours or tell jokes -  but grew complex over time - for instance, scanning someone's face, identifying age and gender, and providing targeted advertisement of products through voice and visual feedback (tablet screen).

My role in the project was twofold. On the one hand, I worked with the rest of the IT Innovation team in designing and programming apps for demo deployments. I worked I have developed voice interaction applications for some of the case studies, 
I have mostly focused on the design of dialog flows and front end development in python integrating various APIs . The majority of tasks I have programmed are informative dialogs and text to speech and speech to text conversions. 

I focused on tasks such as: provide users with data on Cosmote’s products and services, tell jokes based on age and sex (using age and sex recognition services) or provide real time information on weather and other popular subjects using APIs and parse data from websites.

I have assisted in user testing and collecting field observations for further research and development. A specific focus group were children. 

One of the key difficulties in interacting with Pepper was its response time: the Robot needed a few seconds
