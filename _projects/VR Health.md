As part of my role in [COSMOTE-DT IT Innovation Team](https://www.cosmote.gr/static/otegroup/en/page/it_innovation_center_new) I worked with [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) and [Unity](https://unity.com/learn) (for Oculus Rift, Gear VR and Google VR) to prototype lightweight VR/AR Proof of Concepts for various use cases. The purpose of these prototypes was to communicate, discuss and evaluate interaction concepts and product ideas with internal and external stakeholders prior to committing to collaborations with external partners - e.g. startups -for full-scale end-to-end development of the envisioned product. 

The VR health and safety training was implemented and finalized in collaboration with [Enneas](https://enneas.gr/post/vr-safety-training). The purpose of the VR training was to gamify the health and safety regulations for entry level field technicians working in COSMOTE-DT Telecom. The VR training focused on the correct use of equipment and ladder use to prevent from field accidents, simulating wearing virtual gloves, positioning safety items, and a realistic scenario of using the ladder to repair cables/faulty lines. The VR training simulated different weather and lighting conditions, and gave the experience of a realistic fall - in the case the the ladder was positioned inappropriately or other safety regulations were not met.

I supported the initial stages of the project prior to contractor involvement as a UX designer, gathering requirements from internal teams (e.g. Field Technicians, Health and Safety department etc.), sketching and prototyping VR scenarios to demonstrate potential scenes user interactions for the VR training and to support reaching conscensous between internal stakeholders. After the Enneas (contractor) took over the project's implementation, I assisted in the aesthetic and technical development of the  project and acted as an intermediate between the health and safety department and the contractor to align internal requirements with product features. I worked on designing/improving UI features and conducted iterative user testing and design evaluations to ensure product's useability and user experience. 

Overall, the product's release was marked with success. Field technicians thought the VR training was far more engaging than before; particularly referring to the opportunity to experience a fall as highly beneficial. The VR training reduced training costs for COSMOTE-DT, as they could skip the costs of in-person meeting, hiring dedicated personnel, or the need to provide insurance for the initial training.

Beyond this specific VR training project, I have participated in designing and developing AR/VR demos for various use-cases, predominantly customer engagement. Connectivity was a gamified VR experience showcasing use of smart home equipment provided by COSMOTE-DT. Other use cases included AR games in-store to win credits, and developing an augmented reality product catalog for in-store use.
